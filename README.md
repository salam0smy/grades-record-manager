# grades-record-manager
Something I wrote recently to refresh my C++/C


The application reads grades.txt file and present a menu to do the following:
  * Search using ID number
  * Populate the average grade
  * Add, edit, and remove enteries
  * List the grades
  * Sort the list using ID, grade, or name
  * Save to a file
